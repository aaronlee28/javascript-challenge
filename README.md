# javascript-challenge

This project is from the perspective of a data analyst at ALIENS - R - REAL, where the goal is to write code that creates a table dynamically based upon a dataset that is provided. The code also allows users to filter the table data for specific values, such as date/time, city, state, country, and shape. Since the company only trusts certain programs, only pure JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js are used for the web pages.
